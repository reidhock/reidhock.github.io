I"4<p>Hi, My name is WoongHee Lee based in South Korea.</p>

<p>You made it till here! I was worried you’d leave me after seeing my photo on the main page. I don’t know why I am writing this in English. Prolly I am too shy or awkward to write in my own native language? I don’t usually talk about myself or write “about me”. I guess nobody writes “about me” often. I am rambling haha.</p>

<p>I’ve recently started to learn programming and discover a whole new world. So I decided to share with other people what I have been learning and get some inspiration from other developers out in the world.</p>

<p>I have a beautiful wife that I met in college and world’s biggest and cutest dog that we got the second after we were married. I still don’t know if it was a right decision or not, but we love her with our whole heart.</p>

<p>Deciding to become a programmer was a huge jump for me and I really want to have fun with it and get better at it. Plus, if I can make good money off of it, that would be even better haha! But seriously, someday I want to be a part of future tech/IT world and leave a positive impact on the world.</p>

<p>I am so excited to meet some new people here and let’s have fun!</p>
